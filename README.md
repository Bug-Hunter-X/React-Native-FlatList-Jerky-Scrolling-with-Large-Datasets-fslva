# React Native FlatList Performance Issue

This repository demonstrates a common performance problem in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets and complex item rendering.  The bug manifests as jerky or unresponsive scrolling.  The solution focuses on optimizing rendering and improving memory management.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a FlatList implementation that renders a large dataset with complex components. This leads to performance issues, especially on lower-end devices.  Scrolling becomes sluggish and unresponsive.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides an optimized solution using techniques like `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `shouldComponentUpdate` to improve rendering performance and reduce memory usage.
