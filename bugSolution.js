The solution involves optimizing the rendering process of the FlatList items.  We'll use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components if their props haven't changed.  `useMemo` will help to memoize expensive calculations, and further performance enhancements can be achieved using `shouldComponentUpdate` in custom components.

```javascript
// optimized FlatList implementation
const MemoizedComplexItemComponent = React.memo(ComplexItemComponent);

<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <MemoizedComplexItemComponent item={item} />
  )}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  // additional optimizations can be added here
/>
```

The `ComplexItemComponent` should also be optimized:

```javascript
const ComplexItemComponent = React.memo(({ item }) => {
  const expensiveCalculation = useMemo(() => calculateSomething(item), [item]);

  return (
    // ... your component JSX ...
  );
});
```

For components with complex state logic, `shouldComponentUpdate` can provide more fine-grained control over when to re-render:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    // Implement logic to determine if a re-render is needed
    return !shallowEqual(this.props, nextProps) || !shallowEqual(this.state, nextState);
  }
  // ... rest of the component
}
```
By combining these techniques, we can significantly improve the scrolling performance of the FlatList with large datasets.
