This React Native bug arises when using the FlatList component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  The issue manifests as an erratic scroll behavior, where scrolling becomes jerky, unresponsive, or completely stops. The cause is often linked to inefficient rendering or layout calculations within the FlatList's item components.  Additionally, memory leaks can contribute to performance degradation over time.

```javascript
// buggy FlatList implementation
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <ComplexItemComponent item={item} />
  )}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```

`ComplexItemComponent` might involve multiple nested views, images, or complex calculations, leading to excessive rendering time.
